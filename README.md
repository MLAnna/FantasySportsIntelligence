This project applies unsupervised learning to cluster professional sports players based on their past season performances for OnSports, a global fantasy sports platform. By identifying patterns in player data, the analysis helps fantasy sports participants set accurate prices, optimize team composition, and uncover high-value players. With the fantasy sports market projected to grow to $92.52 billion by 2032, this analysis provides data-driven insights for better decision-making in the competitive fantasy sports landscape. Clustering analysis offers methodical insight into player performance by clearly analyzing the multi-dimensional data available.

By leveraging this clustering analysis, fantasy sports participants and platform operators can gain actionable insights to set optimal player prices, improve team selection, and uncover hidden performance trends. Whether you’re a player looking to dominate your fantasy league or a platform aiming to enhance user engagement, this code provides a powerful tool to make data-driven decisions. The project is fully customizable, allowing users to input their own data, adjust clustering parameters, and adapt the analysis to their specific needs.

The code is well-commented and user-friendly, making it accessible even to those with minimal coding experience. The results from the clustering analysis can directly improve your fantasy team performance by helping you spot undervalued players and avoid overpaying for high-profile stars. You’ll also have access to simple yet powerful data visualization tools that make it easy to understand the player landscape and make informed, data-driven decisions. Advanced interactive visualizations will help you visualize player groupings and performance trends with ease.

Get started by cloning the repository and exploring how clustering analysis can transform your fantasy sports experience. Whether you’re a data scientist or fantasy sports enthusiast, this project empowers you to make smarter decisions backed by data.
